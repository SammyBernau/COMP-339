TODO 

1. Compute collisions
2. Format hamlet.txt so that it reads word by word 
3. Compute unique word ID list
4. filter hamlet with dictionary? 
5. Graph collision results (python or Shell script)


- choose a minimum length of words to use with bloom filter
- find the number of collisions 
- spdlog instead of cout/cerr for logging https://github.com/gabime/spdlog
- maybe hash the same word a few times and concatenate it to create a unique word ID (push to vector array after for word cloud)
- Set up filter w/ dict, search to see if hamlet words are there
