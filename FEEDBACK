Caesar cipher is really  nicely put together.
10/10

Bloom
I'm not able to tell whether this is working or not, so my grade is based on the effort, which looks solid.

When I run the app, here is what happens:
îº§ ./build/bin/bloom_app -s 20 -n 2
Enter "q" or "quit" to exit -> Would you like to insert or search a string? -> q

The program is supposed to work by reading in a file and seeing whether the (m,k) values work.
It looks like you may not be done yet, which is ok, but please try to finish soon.

8/10 for now on the Bloom part.
